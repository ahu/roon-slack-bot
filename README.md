# roon-slack-bot
Roon extension for posting playing status to Slack

**Getting started**

* The extension uses Imgur for attaching album art to Slack messages. In order for the extension to access the Imgur API, you'll need an Imgur Client ID. A Client ID can be created by signing up for a free Imgur account then registering the extension as new Imgur App at: https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient

* To post messages to Slack, the extension requires a Slack webhook. The webhook can be generated by creating a new Slack App for your workspace at: https://api.slack.com/apps. Click the "Create New App" button and give the app a name, e.g. "RoonBot", then choose which workspace to create the app in. After you've created the app go to Features -> Incoming Webhooks. Click "Activate Incoming Webhooks" then "Add new Webhook to Workspace".

* Download and install the NodeJS runtime: https://nodejs.org. Then use the following command to start the extension: `node . --zone=[roon zone name] --webhook=[slack webhook] --imgurid=[imgur client ID]` You'll also need to provide the name of the Zone in Roon for which playing status should be monitored.

* Final step is to activate the extension in Roon. Go to Settings -> Extensions. Find "RoonBot for Slack" and click the "Enable" button.
